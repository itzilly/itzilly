About: 
Hey, my name is illyum (illy for short) and I am an avid Minecraft Player. I've
been playing since 2013 mainly starting out with smp and then moving to more
competitive modes such as CakeWars, Bedwars, The Bridge, Sumo, Skywars, Pot PvP,
etc. I'm currently learning Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS because I love
computers and everything to do with them. I'm working on my first spigot plugin
for my own private uses and plan to make and sell custom plugins for Minecraft as
well as a super customizable hypixel stats overlay in the future once I learn a
little more about python databases and GUIs. Contact me on twitter @illyumscave
